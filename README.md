# Helical coding challenge

This repository reflects a coding assignment of the interview process at Helical AI. 

## Note on LLM usage

The code in this repository was created in conjunction with the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model. I tested, reviewed and modified the code according to my needs to solve the tasks of the challenge. 
Notebooks are my own.
